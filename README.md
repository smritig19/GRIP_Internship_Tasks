# GRIP INTERNSHIP TASKS 

# Data Science & Business Analytics

## TASK 1: Prediction using Supervised ML
* Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. 
* What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? 
* _LANGUAGE:_ Python
* _DATASET:_ http://bit.ly/w-data
## TASK 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML
* From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. 
* _LANGUAGE:_ Python
* _DATASET:_ [Iris.csv](https://github.com/smritig19/GRIP_Internship_Tasks/blob/main/Task%202%20-%20Prediction%20using%20Unsupervised%20ML/Iris.csv)
## TASK 3: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
* Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
* The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly. 
* _LANGUAGE:_ Python
* _DATASET:_ https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
